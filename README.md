## 📊 What I Focus On
- Cleaner, faster loops (time-to-screen/interview SLAs, nudges, scorecard hygiene)
- Higher-signal pipelines (referrals + outbound; time-box inbound)
- Structured decisions (intake → rubric → evidence-linked scorecards)
- Transparent AI (human-in-the-loop; rationale + override notes)
